# grid-js

This project is a small example of how to draw a grid using JavaScript and the HTML 5 canvas tag. It supports a variable number of lines along both the x and y axis as well as light and dark mode.

To run it, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

Here are a couple of screenshots:
